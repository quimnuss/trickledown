# Now

- [ ] Set the solar system
- [ ] Add the city view
- [ ] Add the Working mechanic
- [ ] Add the in-flight burn mechanic

# Next

- [ ] Get the Orbital component working and a planet orbiting (no edge cases)
- [ ] Get the Orbital component working for a ship orbiting
- [ ] Polish the physics engine area2d gravity-based approach
- [ ] Improve the launch craft mechanic to have a TRICKLEDOWN button at set thrust
- [ ] Add the resources logic

# Later

- [ ] Translate from ground flight view to system view trajectory
- [ ] Proper parallax on ship view
- [ ] Consider orbit edge cases
- [ ] Educate oneself with the orbital mechanics equations and how to simulate them
- [ ] SOI change trajectory drawing
- [ ] Switch to high definition planets instead of pixel art
- [ ] Camera controls
- [ ] Game achievements and/or contracts
- [ ] Add rich man life highlights
- [ ] Add rich man side-effects
- [ ] Add successful landing feedback
- [ ] Add the in-flight craft close up view

# Way later

- [ ] Ship constructor

# Done

- [x] Add cannon thrust mechanic
- [x] Add crashes effects
- [x] Add crashes (no effects)
- [x] Add the launch craft mechanic
- [x] Add the ground craft close up view
- [x] Check if there's a way to allow for overlapping area2ds and just apply one
- [x] Start using the physics engine and simple ballistics instead of proper orbit mechanics to demonstrate
- [x] CharacterBody2D cosmonaut
- [x] RigidBody2D astronaut
