# Now - Ship requirements

- [ ] particle gather animation flow towards the milestone list (component)
- [ ] limit cannon angles

## Deute tÃ¨cnic

- [ ] find a way to have the slow timescale as Engine.time_scale = 1
- [ ] Find a way to timescale only the physics and not the animations and cannon control
- [ ] Remove the SaveManager and use the resource directly
- [ ] Use singleton focused body and nothing else to reparent the camera (occhio with the astronaut death)

# Next

- [ ] Set more solar system
- [ ] display which SOI the astronaut is in (on_body_entered if gravity check priority and decide which SOI it is)
- [ ] make the milestones incremental (don't put the whole list)
- [ ] Set the scale of the world to the astronaut instead of the planets (man as a mesure of all things)
- [ ] Polish the physics engine area2d gravity-based approach
- [ ] news feed filter by richmen
- [ ] light

# Later

- [ ] "Hidden folks"-style city with stories 
- [ ] Stats on milestones:  I crashed # times on the home planet
- [ ] Get the Orbital component working for a ship orbiting
- [ ] Get the Orbital component working and a planet orbiting (no edge cases)
- [ ] Add SAS for prograde
- [ ] Consider orbit edge cases
- [ ] Educate oneself with the orbital mechanics equations and how to simulate them
- [ ] SOI change trajectory drawing
- [ ] Add rich man life highlights
- [ ] Add successful landing feedback

# Way later

- [ ] (posponed) Correctly save astronauts' position and velocity
- [ ] Add the in-flight craft close up view
- [ ] Ship constructor
- [ ] Check https://jokeapi.dev/

If ground flight is implemented:

- [ ] Proper parallax on ship view
- [ ] Translate from ground flight view to system view trajectory
